                HiFL速 (an abbreviation for Higher Institutions Football League) is an annual football competition
                designed for higher institutions in Nigeria particularly universities to showcase campus football
                talents, stimulate healthy rivalry and engage them across Nigeria in the unifying spirit of
                sportsmanship while enlisting the most professional practices and management board of renowned
                competence for coordination.
              </p>
              <p>
                In our first edition in 2018, 16 top Nigerian universities across 16 major cities played host to 30
                games over a period of 14 weeks including the Final and Third place which was held at the Lagos Agege
                Stadium and UAM Tillers emerged as champions.
              </p>
              <p>
                For the upcoming 2019 season, the competition will be expanded to include 32 University teams playing 66
                games over 21 weeks to determine the winner of the Ultimate Champions Trophy. The season is scheduled
                for April - October 2019 with the Super Four on the 26th of October in Lagos.
              </p>
              <p>
                The bigger, bolder, better 2019 season will feature a brand new system including a group stage of 32
                teams, divided into eight groups across the two conferences. Seeding will be used in making the draw for
                this stage, and teams will be drawn in groups together with respect to their geographical locations. The
                winning team and the runners-up from each group then progress to the Round of 16.
              </p>
              <p>
                For this stage, the winning team from one group plays against the runners-up from another group, in the
                same geographical distribution - Coastal or Sahel. This condition will remain through the Quarter Final
                and Semi Final until the Super Four where the winners from inter-conferences matches do battle to
                determine who lifts the trophy. The 2019 format will retain the use of the away goals rule to determine
                the winners in the knock out stage.
              </p>
              <p>
                At HiFL速, our goal is to make football, the country's favorite sport REAL to its teeming followers while
                being a stimulus for the development of college sports and consequentially, sports at large in Nigeria.
                This will be achieved by leveraging participating teams' abilities, school's' sense of pride & identity,
                and a common passion for the game. HiFL速 is where the ability of youth and a nation's undying love of
                football meet.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our strategic intent is to position Nigeria as a global campus football powerhouse while empowering and
                showcasing local talents.
